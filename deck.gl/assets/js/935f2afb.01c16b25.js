In addition, it is often convenient to change the interface and behavior of an existing layer using a composite \\"adaptor\\" layer instead of modifying the layer itself (the sample S2Layer is a simple adaptor on top of the PolygonLayer).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-attributes":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-attributes","title":"Layer Attributes","description":"This section explains how the data in deck.gl layers are mapped to and accessed by the GPU during rendering."},"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-extensions":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-extensions","title":"Creating Layer Extensions","description":"It\'s recommended that you read subclassing layers before proceeding"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-lifecycle":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/layer-lifecycle","title":"Layer Lifecycle","description":"Every deck.gl layer subclass can define certain methods that get called","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/picking":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/picking","title":"Picking","description":"Make sure you have read Interactivity before reading this section.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/primitive-layers":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/primitive-layers","title":"Primitive Layers","description":"If you want to draw something completely different and you are comfortable around WebGL2/WebGPU shaders, you may consider implementing a new layer by directly extending the Layer class.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/prop-types":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/prop-types","title":"Property Types","description":"This article documents the system that deck.gl offers to provide extra type annotations for layer properties.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/README":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/README","title":"Writing Your Own Layer","description":"Preparations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/subclassed-layers":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/subclassed-layers","title":"Subclassed Layers","description":"deck.gl layers are designed to be easy to extend in order to add features.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"developer-guide/custom-layers/writing-shaders":{"id":"developer-guide/custom-layers/writing-shaders","title":"Writing Shaders","description":"A shader library facilitates creating shaders that work seamlessly with deck.gl.
